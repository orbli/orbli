+++

Hey, this is second time I write blog - reporting my recent states.

I've got an AMusTCL certification back in June 2024 - which is equivalent to pre-college music theory study in music school. It's so much out of my expectation that I just started study the theory roughly 1 year before.

Being an adult music student, I have basically no faith in advancing my performance techniques - bunch of wrong notes, incapability to play many harder passages etc hit me so hard. However I do believe adult students have a mature aesthetic values that prodigies might not be able to handle.

Back to tech topic. I have been feeling the mdbook is the way to write documentation but not the way to host personal website. I feel my website so awkward over the past few years but did not have the courage to revamp into another framework. Last year, to apply for some startup funding, I quickly made a simple company website in Jekyll following github guideline. The experience made me confident on trying out other website framework, and now hugo has grown to a size that i feel confident to stay with.

The old mdbook site would still persist as one of my repository in github but no longer point to orbb.li - I merely remember I did a lot of debugging to make CI work so I hope it help me somewhere in future.

Happy Valentine Day!
