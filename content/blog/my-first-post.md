Honestly, this is the first time I use [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) for a website. This site previously was a simple html with css templates, and was maintained like a mess. 

Using mdbook, write things in markdown is much easier and also open up opportunity in writing blog post here. I can't imagine write blog posts in my previous pure html website...

I have no intention to advocate anything here. Maybe I will come back and write something whenever I find it interesting enough to share. It might be a software architectual problem, or some practical coding problem, or cryptography, or mathematics problem or even some macro economics problem! With the ease I can use markdown here, I'm sure contents here will be filled shortly - once I develop the habit of recording my memorible moment!
